/**
 * manageOldPullRequests closes our own pull requests once they have been inactive for a
 * specified number of days.
 *
 * Inactivity is the age of the last human event on the pull request, not GitHub's
 * `updated_at`. Searching on `updated:<` misses exactly the pull requests this is meant to
 * find: any bot touching a label resets that clock, and a milestone rotation in
 * shopwell/shopwell did so for 71 of 273 open pull requests in one pass, leaving the
 * candidate pool there empty. `created:<` is the prefilter instead — nothing stale for
 * `days` can have been opened more recently than that — and the real measure runs over the
 * result.
 *
 * Both the author and the assignee have to hold a verified organization email. The
 * assignee check alone does not keep this off community contributions: assigning a
 * maintainer to one is the good practice, and it used to be what made it eligible for
 * closing. Closing someone else's contribution is a decision for a person, not for a cron
 * job.
 *
 * @param toolkit - Octokit instance. See: https://octokit.github.io/rest.js
 * @param organization - The GitHub organization to check for old pull requests.
 * @param days - Consider pull requests old after this many days of inactivity.
 * @param close - If true, the pull request will be closed after sending the reminder.
